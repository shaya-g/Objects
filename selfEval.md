# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I did not really struggle with this section- it was actually pretty straightforward and I enjoyed learning about Objects a ton! :)

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

Note-taking is going alright! I think I need to write the syntax of code in bold letters because it is easier to see that way and notice every little detail. I take the most helpful notes when I make sure to highlight important information.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I usually try and solve the problem in code on my own first and then if I am really struggling, I refer to Google.
